# SLDeparturesPY
Simple python class for fetching departures from SL

You need an API key for "SL Realtidsinformation 4", get it at https://www.trafiklab.se/
Then you also need an siteId (id for the stop), you could get it by using the "SL Platsuppslag" API

Python isnt really my game so feel free to give me feedback.
